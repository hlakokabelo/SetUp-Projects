# SetUp-Projects

## Description
As a student assistant, I was tasked with marking around 20 weekly practicals. Each practical was submitted as a zipped file that had to be manually extracted.  
To streamline the process, I developed **setup-projects**, a tool that:

- Unzips multiple practicals at once  
- Removes Eclipse-generated configuration files  
- Replaces them with standardized configuration files to ensure compatibility with my development environment
