As a student assistant. I was tasked with marking weekly practicals, so I would have to download and unzip about 20 pracs. 
I created this software to do the unzipping for me, and to remove certain configuration files that were automatically created by eclipse. 
These files would then be replaced by my files, so that eclipse has configuration files that work on my PC.
